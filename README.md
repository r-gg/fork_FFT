# Cooley-Tukey Fast Fourier Transform

The program computes the Fourier Transform of its input values recursively through the use of **forks** and **pipes**.

The input of the program are floating point values, which should be read from stdin. Subsequent values are separated by a newline character. The sequence ends when an EOF (End Of File) is encountered.

## Usage 

```
./forkFFT
```
